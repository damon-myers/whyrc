# whyrc

`whyrc` is a smol TCP chat application built to help me learn a bit of network programming with Rust.

It has:

- chat rooms straight out of 1999
- a ðŸš€ blazingly fast ðŸš€ TUI application
- a multithreaded server to keep things ðŸš€ blazingly fast ðŸš€ when chatting with your 2 other friends

Why you shouldn't use it:

- No e2e encryption
- No real user authentication
- No support for DMs
- It uses JSON for serialization
- It's susceptible to DDOS attacks by creating numerous TCP connections

## Usage Instructions Anyways
